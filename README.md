# GIS -> Cartodb

An incomplete attempt to adapt
[am2carto](https://github.com/AKROGIS/am2cartodb)
into a solution for exporting the
AKRO GIS enterprise datasets (roads, trails, etc) to
[cartodb](https://cartodb.com/) for
use in park tiles and potentially national aggregation.

This project was overcome by the
[NGP Data Aggregator](https://github.com/nationalparkservice/NGP-Data-Aggregator).
